      Rukmini Devi has been considered as a very strong support and a revolution in getting back Bharatanatyam after its ban during British colonial rule.
      She established Kalashetra, a school for training in Bharatanatyam. She was also Vice-President of the International Vegetarian Union for 31 years until she passed away in 1986.

  Yamini Krishnamurthy was ever keen to learn dance and shifted to Chennai at the age of 5 to pursue dancing. She joined Kalashestra, the dance school run by legendary Rukmini Devi.
   Her first performance itself made her the star overnight and by 1960, she had toured in many parts of the world showcasing her skills and talent.
   She is the proud author of ‘A Passion for Dance’ and just like the name, she dedicated her whole life to dancing.
