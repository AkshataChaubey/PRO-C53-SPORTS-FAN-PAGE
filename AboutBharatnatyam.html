     <li>Bharatanatyam is over 2000 years old. It is a dance primarily originating
      in the state of Tamil Nadu in southern India. It is also the oldest
      surviving classical dance in India. Bharat Muni’s Natyashastra and
      Abhinaya Darpana by Nandikesvara talk about this dance form. It is
      believed that Bharatnatyam was revealed by Lord Brahma to Bharata.
      Bharatanatyam was originally performed exclusively by female temple
      dancers and was not brought to the stage for public performance until
      about 1930.

        <li>
      According to the Hindu tradition the name of the dance form was derived by
      joining two words, ‘Bharata’ and Natyam’ where ‘Natyam in Sanskrit means
      dance and ‘Bharata’ is a mnemonic comprising ‘bha’, ‘ra’ and ‘ta’ which
      respectively means ‘bhava’ that is emotion and feelings; ‘raga’ that is
      melody; and ‘tala’ that is rhythm. Thus, traditionally the word refers to
      a dance form where bhava, raga and tala are expressed.
